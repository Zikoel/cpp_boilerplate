Very stupid cpp project templates with some mininal dependecy resolved.

The use is left very simple, more complex one have no sense due the fact that there are most powerfull tools for that.

## Usage

`./start <template-name> <project-name> <project-path>`

**template-name**: Can be one of the available templates.
**project-name**: The name of your new project
**project-path**: The path where you want to put your new project. The folder should **not** finish with `/`

 * `args_quick`: Simple minimal project with [args](https://github.com/Taywee/args) resolved.
